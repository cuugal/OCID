<P>
LOGIN</BR>
Different login ID's have different access privileges within the system. In addition to the access that a general user has, your login will allow you to edit the inventory of the location that you manage and no other.</P>

<P>Once logged in, the black bar at the top of the screen shows four options</P>

<UL>
<LI>Search chemicals</LI>
<LI>Update &amp; Add</LI>
<LI>Risk Assessment</LI>
<LI>Admin</LI></UL>

<BR>
<B>SEARCH CHEMICALS</B></BR>

<b>Search for one chemical in all locations</b><BR>
Enter the chemical name or CAS # of the chemical and leave the location menu showing 'ALL', then click 'Search'.<P>
<b>Return a list of all chemicals in a single location.</b><BR>
Use the drop-down list to choose a location. Enter an asterisk, * , in the chemical name box then click 'Search'. The asterisk <i>wildcard</i> character represents <b>all</b> chemicals. Don't try to search <I>all</I> chemicals in <I>all</I> locations - there are thousands of chemicals in the system!<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>NOTE: You can perform a wildcard search by using an asterisk in place of any group of characters within the chemical name e.g. entering  cop*  will return all chemicals starting with &quot;cop&quot;, entering b*acid will return acids starting with &quot;b&quot;. Entering  *sodium* will return all chemicals with the word &quot;sodium&quot; somewhere in the name.<BR>
Searches are not case sensitive.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Click on a chemical name for more details on that particular chemical container. The 'back' button on your browser will take you back to your search list.
<P>
<BR>
<B>UPDATE AND ADD</B>
</BR>This allows you to update the existing inventory data and add new chemicals to the inventory.</P>
<P><b>Add a new chemical</b> - when a new chemical arrives to your laboratory or store, you can add that chemical to the inventory straight away simply by filling out the online form. Select your location from the drop down list then click 'Add a new chemical to this location'.</P>
<P><b>Edit list of chemicals</b> – allows you to change information on records of existing chemicals or delete records of chemicals.</P>
<P>When you do a stock take:</P>

<OL>
<LI>First print out your stores inventory using the 'Search' section by 
	<UL>
	<LI>selecting your location and putting an * in the chemical name box 
	<LI>click 'Search'
	<LI>click on 'Print' in the top left corner of the window (or print the bottom frame using the browser print button).
	</UL>
NOTE: To fit more information on one page and save paper when printing, you may want to remove the header/footer options in 'page setup' of your browser and change the font size to 8 point.
<LI>Take the printout of your stock to the store and mark on the printout with pen any changes to the stock levels. </LI>
<LI>In the 'Update & Add' section, select your location from the drop-down list and click 'Edit List of Chemicals at this Location'.  It  may take a couple of minutes to respond if you have hundreds of items stored at this location. </LI>
<LI>Make changes to the list based on the marked printout. </LI>
<LI>Submit these changes by clicking the 'Update Chemical Inventory' button <b>at the bottom of the screen</b> once you have made all the changes you require. This may take a minute. Changes can be made at a number of sittings, just note where you are up to.</LI>
</OL>
NOTE: Entries may need to be deleted or consolidated. The only information that would usually change between stocktakes is 'Quantity' and 'Specific Location'. If you wish, you can preserve information on an item that no longer exists, by changing its quantity to zero.<BR>
<P>Keep an inventory less than 300 entries to make this process easier. Your stock locations can be split into smaller locations, such as a store and the laboratory itself. </P>

<BR>
<B>RISK ASSESSMENTS</B></BR>
If you are <I>using</I> a chemical that is <I>hazardous</I> you will need to use the risk assessment section to help you record your risk assessment details. It is a legal requirement that before you use a chemical you must:</P>

<UL>
<LI>identify the level of risk associated with the way that particular hazardous substance is used,</LI>
<LI>assess the risk of harm that the chemical can cause and</LI>
<LI>control the risk of harm.</LI></UL>


<P>This section is designed to make it easy to record you risk assessment details.</P>

<OL>

<LI>Open up the OCID site and go to the 'risk assessment' section</LI>
<LI><b>Search for one chemical in all locations</b> or <b>Return a list of all chemicals in a single location</b> 
<i>(see the Search Chemicals section above)</i>.</LI>
<LI>Click on 'add' next to the chemical for which you wish to create a new risk assessment*.</LI>
<LI>Fill out the risk assessment form and click the 'Add the New Risk Assessment' button at the bottom of the page to save the assessment.</LI>
<LI>Click the 'Search Risk Assessment' button again to see the new assessment in the list. </LI>
<LI>By clicking 'View' you can have a look at the details of any assessment. At the bottom of the page are the buttons 'Undo Changes', 'Update' and 'Delete'. These allow you to make changes to the assessment later if needed. 'Undo Changes' removes any changes to the assessment form that have not yet been saved. 'Update' saves the assessment details. 'Delete' deletes the whole assessment.</LI>
<LI>Print the assessment to have it signed by your supervisor once all the recommended controls are in place (you may want to remove the header/footer options in 'page setup' of your browser or reduce the font size).</LI>
<LI>Keep the signed assessment in a folder.</LI></OL>

<P>Keep an inventory of a 'Location' less than 300 entries. Your stock locations can be split into smaller locations, such as a store and the laboratory itself, or different room numbers. </P>
<P>Each location has these attributes:</P>
<B><P>Building location</B> – Campus and building name (e.g. City, Building 4)</P>
<B><P>Store location</B> - Room number or store number. If the location holds more than 250 chemicals, then break up into separate locations to keep to less than 250. (e.g. Bay 1 and Bay 2). This make updating easier.</P>
<B><P>Store Type</B> – To describe the store (e.g. laboratory or dangerous goods class 3 store)</P>
<B><P>Manager</B> –<B> </B>Name of lab manager</P>

<P>Each chemical container type has these attributes:</P>
<B><P>Chemical Name </B>– searchable chemical name</P>
<B><P>Specific Location </B>– within the store 'Location' it is kept e.g. Fridge A or DG3 cabinet #1</P>
<B><P>Owner </B>– of the chemical container (e.g. name of center, school or person)</P>
<B><P>Grade </B>– of the chemical in this container (e.g. analytical reagent, laboratory grade)</P>
<B><P>Container Size </B>– size of the container, not how much is left in it</P>
<B><P>Quantity </B>– number of these particular containers</P>
<B><P>CAS # </B>- Chemical Abstracts Service registry number</P>
<B><P>Other info </B>– anything you want (e.g. supplier and catalogue number)</P>
<B><P>Hazardous (Yes/No)</B> – whether it is hazardous according to MSDS</P>
<B><P>Dangerous Goods Class </B>– that is shown on container label and MSDS</P>
