Different login ID’s have different access privileges within the system. Your login will allow you to search the database for a chemical and to be able to write a risk assessment for any chemical in the inventory.</P>

Information retrieved on any one chemical includes - location, grade, lab manager, hazardous nature and dangerous goods class.<BR>

<P>Once logged in, the black bar at the top of the screen shows four options</P>

<B>SEARCH CHEMICALS</B>
<BR>
<b>Search for one chemical in all locations</b><BR>
Enter the chemical name or CAS # of the chemical and leave the location menu showing 'ALL' .<BR>

Click on a chemical name for more details on that particular chemical container. The 'back' button on your browser will take you back to the search list.<P>

<b>Return a list of all chemicals in a single location.</b><BR>
Use the drop-down list to choose a location. Enter an asterisk,  * , in the chemical name box then click 'Search'. The asterisk <i>wildcard</i> character represents <b>all</b> chemicals. Don't try to search <I>all</I> chemicals in <I>all</I> locations - there are thousands of chemicals in the system!<P>

You can perform a wildcard search by using an asterisk in place of any group of characters within the name of a chemical e.g. entering &quot;cop*&quot; will return all chemicals starting with &quot;cop&quot;, entering &quot;b*acid&quot; will return acids starting with &quot;b&quot;. <P>
Click on a chemical name for more details on that particular chemical container. The ‘back’ button on your browser will take you back to the search list.

<B>RISK ASSESSMENTS</B><BR>
If you are using a chemical that is <I>hazardous</I> you will need to use the risk assessment section to help you record your risk assessment details. It is a legal requirement that before you use a chemical you must:</P>

<UL>
<LI>identify the level of risk associated with the way that particular hazardous substance is used,</LI>
<LI>assess the risk of harm that the chemical can cause and</LI>
<LI>control the risk of harm.</LI></UL>


<P>This section is designed to make it easy to record you risk assessment details.</P>

<OL>

<LI>Open up the OCID site and go to the 'risk assessment' section</LI>
<LI><b>Search for one chemical in all locations</b> or <b>Return a list of all chemicals in a single location</b> 
<i>(see the Search Chemicals section above)</i>.</LI>
<LI>Click on 'add' next to the chemical for which you wish to create a new risk assessment*.</LI>
<LI>Fill out the risk assessment form and click the 'Add the New Risk Assessment' button at the bottom of the page to save the assessment.</LI>
<LI>Click the 'Search Risk Assessment' button again to see the new assessment in the list. </LI>
<LI>By clicking 'View' you can have a look at the details of any assessment. At the bottom of the page are the buttons 'Undo Changes', 'Update' and 'Delete'. These allow you to make changes to the assessment later if needed. 'Undo Changes' removes any changes to the assessment form that have not yet been saved. 'Update' saves the assessment details. 'Delete' deletes the whole assessment.</LI>
<LI>Print the assessment to have it signed by your supervisor once all the recommended controls are in place (you may want to remove the header/footer options in 'page setup' of your browser).</LI>
<LI>Keep the signed assessment in a folder.</LI></OL>
